The clothes that we wear follow a specific template. What we wear on our upper body usually
consists of a shirt and a jacket. On our lower body, we tend to wear shorts, pants, and dresses.
This is a simple template that people can reuse over and over. Others can use this template and
incorporate into their own style known as "fashion". We as a society have evolved far from this
bland look and came up with numerous designs that people could branch their ideas off of.
They create their own designs and proceed to deliver a final piece that properly follows the right
pattern properties.

Design patterns are the clothes that we wear every day. The style that we choose, the clothing
we buy, can be used in many situations in our life. <img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f0/9c/9f/f09c9fcaa42dab60217743d3507be452--mens-fashion-suits-mens-fashion-blog.jpg">
Clothing can be adapted where certain things
can be added or removed. In recent culture, it seems that having less clothing seems to be the
trend now. As time goes on it seems that clothing is becoming more "simple" as people don't
have the time to spend looking at their closet for clothing. The same with software engineering,
programmers would like to have a simple design that they can work efficiently with. Then they
can later build off of the product and improve it. By adding more functionality to a program is like
adding certain aspects to your outfit such as earrings, necklaces, shades, watches, etc. If one
does not like the final product of their creation, they can start over with the same template and
build off from there. By having an efficient starting point, one can share that design then branch
it off to other creating initial "copies" of a design that later pivots to become a different app.

In software engineering. there are many design patterns that developers can choose from. For
the final project, my design pattern was based off on bowlfolios. This design pattern got me
started with an initial template of a login/register system using meteor. <img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="https://fossbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/loved-hated-programming-languages.jpg">Then I had to incorporate
my project's idea into this design pattern. This template was also used by the rest of my
classmates as a starting point for their project. An example of a design pattern I used is
singleton where I created an instance of profiles that was called and exported all over my
project. Most of the design patterns in bowlfoilios I was able to replicate it in my project as I also
used meteor to route my pages and layouts. I also was able to create a database and check the
collections of the database and update it accordingly with user accounts. This form of design
pattern is front controller allowing me to have one point where I can access all the data.
