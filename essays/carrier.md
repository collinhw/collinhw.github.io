Unlimited text, talk, data are essential components of smartphones. Online
communication, whether it is produced verbally or visually needs to be stable and reliable. High
speed connection is offered by all carriers. The differences is the prices people pay for their
connection. T-Mobile has offered unlimited LTE data for some time, compared to Verizon who
recently announced will provide unlimited data. T-Mobile’s ad “NSFWireless” uses sexual
comedy to reference a masochist teasing Verizon’s lack of unlimited data. The ad are trying to
target their respective audience while throwing shade at each other through their commercials
and foster competition between T-Mobile and Verizon that benefits consumers when announcing
new plans and prices. T-Mobile’s ad uses comedy effectively to appeal to their customers,
compared to Verizon’s awkward actions of an internet meme. The American audience should
want a strong rivalry between phone companies as their main source of communication that lies
within their networks.
These carriers use two different approaches when selling their product. T-Mobile uses
sexual humor from Kristen Schaal. She calls Verizon’s customer service alerting them that she
has gone over her data limit (#NSFWireless 0:02). The Verizon employee then states that she
will be charged in terms of taxes and fees. The employee looks confused to the tone of Schaal's

voice as she may genuinely enjoy being billed. When Schaal hears the bill statement, she
proceeds to gasp as if she were just whipped (#NSFWireless 0:24). Schaal demands to hear the
words again as she satisfies herself with a piece of chocolate. When Schaal begins to moan, the
audience questions the seriousness of this ad, but as the commercial progresses, the mocking
tone conveys a creative sales pitch: T-Mobile One was announced before Verizon’s first
announcement of unlimited data usage. At the end of the commercial nowhere did it mention the
price, but just stated that taxes and fees were included (#NSFWireless 0:56). This is a smart
marketing ploy that pushes customers to go on their site that gives them the option to explore
specific plans that they could not mention in the commercial.
After T-Mobile’s “attack” on Verizon, people would expect Verizon to retaliate by
providing unlimited data, or keep their current plans. Using a commercial as an announcement
they mention reliability, and the price. Whether wireless data is reliable or not can be biased
towards one’s perception of a company. When Verizon’s speaker, Thomas Middleditch, was
constantly reiterating the price per line is $45, he was trying to emphasize a cheap plan that
Verizon was providing (Drop the Mic, 0:20). This may seem like a cheaper deal but the
commercial forgot to include a specific message “$45 per/4 lines” (Drop the Mic, 0:28). This
means that in order for one line to be $45, a customer must purchase four lines, comparing to
T-Mobile’s four line plan of $40 per/4 lines. Arguably, T-Mobile has the cheaper plan, yet
Verizon want to emphasize the dollar amount of $45. T-Mobile’s One Unlimited plan focused on
a two line option, by default is $50 per 2 lines, that adjusts based on extra lines. Both default
options $45 per 4 lines vs $50 per/2 lines, Verizon’s plan looks more appealing by providing for

the average household size, but the differences of these two plans are the costs and biased
reliability.
Phone companies provide their customers with the tools to stay relevant in a fast paced
world. There are many services to choose from: T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, etc. To differentiate
themselves they have to provide a unique benefit that draws customers in. Verizon’s new
unlimited data plan is now available to compete with other carriers. Non-Verizon customers can
now have an option to switch if they feel that their current plan is not optimal. T-Mobile’s
commercial was focused on Verizon’s limited data plans. In response to this commercial,
Verizon released their announcement to counteract T-Mobile’s. Verizon wants to state that they
too can provide unlimited data at a comparable price, it is now up to the customers to decide
which plan is better. However, the viewership between the two commercials are vastly different.
T-Mobile’s was played during the SuperBowl, compared to Verizon’s which was uploaded to
Youtube 12 days later. A glance at the Youtube viewership reveals big differences in numbers,
26 million views vs. 2 million views, T-Mobile and Verizon respectively.T-Mobile has been
offering unlimited data since 2011, giving their customers the chance to have an opinion on their
unlimited network. As for Verizon, they are introducing it again leaving customers to question
their reliability. American smartphone users are constantly looking for better plans, as carriers
offer benefits if customers switch to theirs.
Commercials use specific people to capture their audience’s attention. T-Mobile’s use of
logos is shown by the casting. Kristen Schaal was known for voicing Mabel Pines of Gravity
Falls, her voice draws the attention of people who have watched the show before. Verizon also
casted a celebrity: Thomas Middleditch, who plays Richard Henriks of Silicon Valley, uses

awkward stutters to draw in their audience. T-Mobile uses a satirical form of “sex sells”, while
Verizon uses an internet meme. T-Mobile targets a general audience of parents and millennials
when coming up with this commerical, compared to Verizon who are tries to target young adults
that spend majority of their time online. When watching these commercials, as they are
lighthearted and carefree, most people will not take seriously because it is a form of humor.
T-Mobile applies pathos by getting people to laugh - they want their audience to think how
ridiculous it is for Verizon to not have an unlimited data plan. In response, Verizon created a
new commercial announcing that they now have an unlimited data plan to relive added pressure.
Verizon wants to throw some confusion out there, giving the people more choices to choose
from, as for Verizon customers this gives them a breath of hope, while the undecided still has a
sizeable list to choose from.
During the Super Bowl, T-Mobile isn’t the only carrier to attack Verizon’s prices and
reliability. Sprint also broadcasted a commercial that attacked Verizon’s lack of unlimited data.
For a carrier to attack another rivaling carrier can be seen as immature and unprofessional. This
is not the case for T-Mobile, as their Super Bowl ad revealed their new unlimited plan. As a
company they understand that their plans are cheaper and popular, which forces Verizon
customers to question if their plan is worth the cost. Verizon releasing their commercial proves
that T-Mobile was right and their hand was forced. Verizon’s commercial does not hurt
themselves necessarily as they will benefit by providing an unlimited plan, yet they had the
chance to implement this idea when other carriers were doing it. It’s almost as if Verizon had no
other choice, or they would start to lose customers to other companies. These commercials may
seem like harmless banter that benefits the sellers, but in the end the consumer benefits the most.

If one carrier were to increase their prices, other carriers would develop a cheaper plan that
customers can switch to.
Proper communication is an important factor for every job. Customers want to purchase
the best products in the market at a affordable price. When multiple companies are fighting for
their consumer’s wallets, it’s beneficial for them to think of innovative plans to build loyalty
within their brand. Society wants cheap and reliable service which is not always going to be the
case. Paying for a cheaper service means sacrificing reliability, while a more reliable connection
is going to eat up one’s wallet. The audience should see T-Mobile’s commercial as a gift for
Verizon customers. Due to this ad, it may have pushed Verizon to reintroduce unlimited data that
won’t throttle data after the customer has used over 14 GB of data. This should also make
T-Mobile customers enthusiastic because T-Mobile has to find new ways to attract customers.
One of the easiest methods would be to adjust their prices, as most consumers see that T-Mobile
is the cheaper option. The lower the prices the happier a consumer can be, as they can afford to
spend their money on other luxuries.
Healthy competition that brings out better products benefits both consumers and
producers. The telecommunication markets are constantly attracting new customers through
social media and advertisements. When one carrier can offer a better plan that has a cheaper
price, others need to respond quickly before seeing a drop in sales. Commercials are great ways
to advertise new products, especially when it’s advertised during the Super Bowl. Proper timing
allowed a wider coverage for T-Mobile’s new product. Although T-Mobile’s commercial
contradicted with Verizon’s, T-Mobile was able to expand to a larger audience that allowed them

to attract new customers. Consumers can look forward to future telecommunication rivalries
when looking for better products.
