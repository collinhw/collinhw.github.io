title: Impressions on Javascript

When it came to spoken languages such as Chinese or Japaneses, I was always very proficient
in them as I would memorize the new vocabulary and be able to ace tests that way. However,
when it comes to coding languages it's different because I need to understand how the
concepts and language works. I can't expect to memorize a block of code and and write the
exact same code on an exam or on a interview question. Javascript is the fourth language I
learned (Java, C#, C++), and as of right now I am a bit more comfortable with the basics of the
language after taking the first WAD. I am still having a bit of syntax issues as I was so used to
having types for variables not just "let" and "const". I also noticed that making functions is
simpler than C#, as you need to have function prototypes, and datatypes for your functions.

I think that Javascript is a good language to start for software engineering as people can build
off their portfolio with web development. Then later branch out to other languages such as CSS
and HTML. I found the practice WADs to be extremely useful. My first WAD I was stuck up on a
bug, and my head kept thinking about the time constraint. <img class="ui medium left floated rounded image"

have the same pressure as a normal WAD the material is very similar and very applicable to the
real thing. Having stress involved with coding is a frustrating thing that I want to learn to control.
I want to be able to limit the stress and not focus on the time restriction.

This is a new type of learning for me as I never had any real pressure or frustration when it
comes to school work. Even when it came to my first week of finals as a freshmen. My exams
were only 10 ~ 15% of my grade, which means that as long as I keep my homework and
midterm grades up, I do not have to get a very high score to receive an A. With WADs, it is pass
or fail which is huge pressure because of the amount of points I will lose if I even make one
mistake or overlook a bug. But this is a step in the right direction for my current learning
regimen. I shouldn't rely on my short term memory just to earn grades, I should be able to
create a deeper understanding for myself and apply it to future WADs.
