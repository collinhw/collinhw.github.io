As a ICS major going into the spring of my sophomore year, my programming skills are
not up to par compared to the rest of my peers. During the course of this semester I want to
improve my programming and problem solving skills. I hope that my experiences in this class
can carry on to my future ICS classes and later on to my future job.

I am interested in the security side of software engineering. It is important for me to
understand the basics of it first before moving onto the security portion. As a “gamer” I love
playing video games (PC), and after my ICS 111 project I enjoyed the aspect of making games.
The hard part for me was making an original game that hasn’t been made yet. With the help of
this class, I plan to use it as a stepping stone to produce different projects for myself over the
summer.

I understand that in software development there are multiple group projects. Although
programming skills are important, I want to improve on my social and communication skills.
When doing group assignments or activities, there is an awkward silence before and after an
activity. I want to be able to facilitate a healthy flow of conversation that keeps my group
members from staying silent and doing the work by themselves.
