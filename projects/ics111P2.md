summary: An object oriented programming project that deals with animation based on mouse clicking.
---



My second project was a new chapter in programming for me as I was introduced to Object Oriented Programming. This is an individual project where I had to make an animation for three to four characters. Each character would have its own class that is extended from the main "character" class. I had a hard time understanding OOP as this was a brand new topic to me at that time. I had to spend a lot longer talking with my TA and ATA to get a better grasp on this topic.


Like my first project, I decided to base my game on League of Legends characters again. <img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/animator.PNG"> Each individual character has different animations that include spinning, sliding, and character sound effects. To input, a command input, either a mouse click on the character itself or a specific key would create the animation. One of the problems that I had with this project was that I couldn't input another animation until the first animation finished. This was an annoying bug that was quickly fixed after I realized that there was a preset timing issue that I had for all my animations.
